      <h2><strong>Be a true hero.</strong></h2><br>
      <p>Since 1914, the Australian Red Cross has been working towards the vision of human dignity, peace, safety and wellbeing for all. From disaster zones to your home neighborhood, we try to be with victims and people who are socially vulnerable, to ensure every person has access to humanitarian aid whenever and wherever he needs it.<br><br>But these are not achievable without your help. The intense bushfires last summer destroyed nearly three thousand homes, and it is estimated to cost more than 103 billion dollars to deal with its aftermath. More recently, Lifeblood donor centers, which is a part of our blood donation program, are calling for help as the current blood supply will run out in a couple of weeks due to the increasing demand caused by the novel Coronavirus outbreak.<br><br>Want to help? Try donating your blood and spare change, or just drop by our store to pick up some fancy clothes. It might look small and worthless, but your little gesture will make you a real hero of someone out there.</p>

        <h2><strong>Blood</strong></h2><br>
        <p>One of the easiest and most helpful ways of donation is giving away blood. A single blood donation can save up to three lives, and over 500,000 people voluntarily gave blood, plasma or platelets between 2018 and 19. Nearly one million blood products were delivered to hospitals and healthcare providers, and just over 1 million and 400 thousand individual blood donations were made during that period.</p><br>
        <p>If you are aged between 18 to 76, and weigh over 50 kilograms, you may be able to give blood. There are 96 blood donor centers including mobile centers in Australia, and you can book a meeting with our Lifeblood team to make a donation. Use the form below to find a center near you, and see if they're avaliable.

        <p>The Australian Red Cross has a reputation for providing the right care and aid for victims of natural disasters. Last year, due to record-breaking bushfires thousands of people lost their homes, and millions more were affected by the devastating flames. After the fire, we were there to provide shelter for those left homeless, and immediately started relief efforts in the disaster-struck areas. Numerous private and official fundraisers has been set up, and we started a program to financially support those severely effected by the catastrophe.</p><br><p>By April 15, 2020 we have raised about 200 million dollars in donations, and have already spent 73 million 3 months into our grants and recovery program. With crystal-clear approvement procedures, we make sure than every cent goes to those desperate in need. You can make a quick single donation by filling out the form below, or for regular donation plans contact us at 1800-RED-CROSS (733 276) or visit the <a href = """https://www.redcross.org.au/support-us/donate-funds">ARC Ways to donate webpage</a>.</p><br>
