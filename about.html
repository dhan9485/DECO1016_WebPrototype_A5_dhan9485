        <h2><strong>What is the Red Cross?</strong></h2><br>
        <p>The red cross emblem is used by the ICRC, or the International Comittee of the Red Cross. It is well-known to the public as a symbol of humanitarian aid, or medics in a warzone. Since it's creation back in 1863, The International Comittee of the Red Cross' sole objecticve has been to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife. It does so through its direct action around the world, as well as by encouraging the development of international humanitarian law (IHL) and promoting respect for it by governments and all weapon bearers(ICRC, 2020). <br><br>Now the Red Cross operates all across the world, in over 90 countries with more than 18,000 staff members. Their main activity is to provide medical relief to those in need, as well as conducting search and rescue operations and pressuring governments to join the fight for humaniy(ICRC, 2020). One of them is the Australian Red Cross (ARC for short) which was formed as the Australian branch of the British Red Cross as the First World War broke out back in 1914. Since then, the ARC has been working to save lives and support those in need before and after a disaster.</p>

        <h2><strong>How can I get involved?</strong></h2><br>
        <p>You can choose different ways of being a part of the Red Cross community. Two of the most common and well-known methods are volunteering and making donations. We provide emergency blood services and monetary support to those in need, so you can choose to donate your blood or money for us to better prepare for the future.<br><br>Volunteering is also a good way to take part since you can gain new skills, share your existing ones and meet new friends by taking part in related activities. It expands your skills and experience, increases your employability and is a way to stay active and engaged with the community. It's also a way for you to give back to the community and help people who need a hand. Visit <a href = "redcross.org.au/get-involved">redcross.org.au/get-involved</a> for more information.
